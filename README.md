## *Experiment scripts and related files* contains experimental scripts and results. In view of the excessive size of the experimental results, they have been stored on a network drive, and the sharing links are provided. On github, you can download the pre-trained model (*035_ckpt.tar* https://github.com/CK-IMUT-501/applsci-1927936/tree/master) saved when the improved model "Transformer_Enc_Dec_Imp + Syn + EZ (Both)" was trained with a random seed of 6421.
## *dep_process* contains scripts for processing dependent syntactic information.
